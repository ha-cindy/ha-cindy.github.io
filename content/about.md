## about me 

|Ë¶Ë™áµ•Ë™ )ï¾‰ï¾ž

Hi there! 

I am a research specialist / lab manager at Princeton University, working with [**Dr. Anuj Shah**](https://anujkshah.com) and [**Dr. Betsy Levy Paluck**](http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/). I graduated from Northwestern University with a double major in Data Science and Psychology in 2024. 

I love exploring how data and people connect, intersect, and interact! I'm a data analyst who views the world through people--looking at ways we understand, make, and judge decisions in the real world. 

In my free time, I enjoy building legos, visiting new restaurants, and creating a list for everything. ðŸ““
