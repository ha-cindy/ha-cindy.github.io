## about me ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³
Hi there! I am a research specialist / lab manager at Princeton University, working with [**Dr. Anuj Shah**](https://anujkshah.com) and [**Dr. Betsy Levy Paluck**](http://www.betsylevypaluck.com/). I graduated from Northwestern University with a double major in Data Science and Psychology in 2024. I plan on applying to graduate school in the 2025 cycle. 

#### **Research Interests** 
Broadly speaking, Iâ€™m interested in how people make decisions, the types of decisions they make, and how we judge others based on these choices. More specifically, I am particularly interested in how these dynamics unfold through the lens of socioeconomic class and immigrant status, focusing on how available opportunities and resources are shaped for different groups. This is motivated by my background as a first-generation, low-income college student and immigrant. 
By integrating psychological and sociocultural perspectives, my research aims to understand not only the individual decision-making process, but also the broader societal narratives that influence and constrain these choices. 

Outside of lab, I enjoy building legos, visiting new restaurants, and creating a list for everything. ðŸ““
